<p>Coding with someone else will help you learn a new language more efficiently. Not only does having a knowledgeable buddy give you the backup you need to figure out a language, but it also gives you someone to teach, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lifehacker.com/learn-more-efficiently-by-planning-to-teach-what-youre-1621733673">which is a great way to learn as well</a>. <a rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/bellebcooper" target="_blank">Belle Beth Cooper</a>, <a rel="noopener" href="https://exist.io/" target="_blank">Exist</a> developer, explains why she finds her coding buddy so valuable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I've yet to find a method of learning that beats having a real person to talk to.</em></p>
<p><em>My co-founder Josh, who's mostly a Python developer, has practically learned Objective-C alongside me thanks to fielding my many programming theory questions ("How does an if statement work again?") and helping me with debugging when I'm truly stuck.</em></p>
<p><em>At the very least, having a patient coding buddy who can explain fundamental programming principles is a huge help. Josh will often help me think through the most logical way to approach a problem, before I work out the specifics of doing so in Objective-C.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having a buddy could be the difference between learning to code in a few months and learning to code in a few weeks.</p>

        <articleContent><![CDATA[<p>Following reports from last month about <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2017/02/17/apples-first-made-in-india-device-could-be-the-iphone-se/#.tnw_e1jXgSV4">Apple preparing to manufacture the iPhone SE in India</a>, the Wall Street Journal reports that the company is adding its <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2014/09/26/apple-begins-selling-iphone-6-iphone-6-plus-20-new-countries/#.tnw_Rh7fiCoC">6</a> and <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2015/09/22/it-is-what-it-is/#.tnw_72CmJz8P">6s</a> models to the lineup that will be assembled there.</p>
<p>A government official from the state of Karnataka said that Taiwanese firm <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.wistron.com/" target="_blank">Wistron</a><a href="https://index.co/company/wistron?utm_source=thenextweb.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hover-wistron" target="_blank" class="idc-hasIcon" data-index=""></a> will begin manufacturing all three handset models at a plant in the capital of Bangalore, starting with the <a href="https://thenextweb.com/topic/iphone/" target="_blank" title="Read more about iPhone.">iPhone</a> 6 and 6s in the next four to six weeks and subsequently the SE in the coming three months.</p>
<div class="ica-wrapper">
<div class="ica-text"></div>
</div>
<p>That should help bring down the cost of Apple<a href="https://index.co/company/Apple?utm_source=thenextweb.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hover-Apple" target="_blank" class="idc-hasIcon" data-index=""></a> devices in India, where the Cupertino-based company’s devices have historically commanded a high price, partly due to import taxes. When the <a href="https://thenextweb.com/topic/iphone-7/" target="_blank" title="Read more about iPhone 7.">iPhone 7</a> launched in India, it <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2016/09/08/the-iphone-7-will-cost-40-more-in-india-than-in-the-us/#.tnw_GgdMtiak">cost roughly 40 percent more</a> than it did in the US, at a price of $903 versus $649.</p>
<p>According to CMR analyst Faisal Kawoosa, manufacturing locally could see iPhone prices drop by as much as $100.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to note that the <a href="https://thenextweb.com/topic/iphone-6/" target="_blank" title="Read more about iPhone 6.">iPhone 6</a> is reportedly going to be manufactured here, as the device is nearly three years old at this point. It’s even been removed from Apple’s India site to make way for the more recent 6s and 7 models. Plus, the company is expected to <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2017/03/06/apple-iphone-8-oled-big-screen/#.tnw_w9fKvrWr">unveil the iPhone 8 this September</a> with a 5.8-inch OLED screen.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the cheaper SE – which was <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2016/03/21/apple-officially-introduces-se-new-4-inch-iphone/#.tnw_gfYl0ycx">launched last March at $399</a> – is understandable, as it just <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/21/14998660/apple-iphone-se-128gb-announced-pricing-release-date" target="_blank">got a storage bump to a minimum of 32GB</a> at the same starting price and is a good entry-level offering for an emerging market like India.</p>
<p>With lower prices, Apple might just have a chance at competing with the likes of Samsung<a href="https://index.co/company/samsung?utm_source=thenextweb.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hover-samsung" target="_blank" class="idc-hasIcon" data-index=""></a> and Lenovo<a href="https://index.co/company/lenovo?utm_source=thenextweb.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hover-lenovo" target="_blank" class="idc-hasIcon" data-index=""></a>, which currently hold 25 percent and 9 percent of India’s smartphone market share.</p>]]></articleContent>

        <articleContent><![CDATA[<p>We need more developers. Seriously. The appetite for apps is insatiable. Apps that are mobile. Apps that are social. Apps that are connected. Apps that are intelligent. It’s not that business users are making these requests for laughs. For businesses to thrive, they are focusing on their customers’ needs, ensuring customer satisfaction today and preparing for success in the future. IT teams and developers are drowning in these requests and we need help – but where are we going to find it?</p>
<p>IDC says there are 18.5 million developers out there coding for the world. But, with the market demanding all these apps, <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/uk/company/news-press/press-releases/2016/06/160607.jsp">the need for developers continues to grow at a rapid pace.</a> So what are our options to fix the supply problem? A 3D printer that churns out developer after developer would be rad, but it has yet to be invented so we’ll have to look elsewhere. We could look to the academic world but, while the revitalisation of coding amongst the younger generation is fantastic, it will take a few years for the next gen to enter the workforce. If we are going to fix this supply problem in the short term we need to think differently and we have to cast the net far and wide.</p>
<p>What about the users? They outnumber developers by a massive factor. What if, rather than flooding IT departments with requests, they were empowered to help themselves? While they wouldn’t be expected to support complex requests, we could give them the tools to ‘self-serve’ parts of the app development process. In short, we can upgrade the user.</p>
<p>To do this, we need to give them two things: a platform for app building; and the knowledge to do so.</p>
<p>The latter is actually an enormous and complex undertaking. There’s definitely a gap in the digital skills of most of the working population – in fact, the latest <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmsctech/270/27003.htm#_idTextAnchor004">digital skills Parliamentary report</a> illustrates that 12.6 million UK adults lack basic digital skills. To bridge the skills gap we need a scalable way to teach a wide range of people how to build apps. These people still have day jobs, so the learning needs to be self-paced and flexible, at any time and any place. Learners will also need guidance on which path to take so they can reach their individual goals. Finally. the whole experience should be fun – most people won’t stick with a course if it feels like a chore. </p>
<p>It’s encouraging to see a number of free educational solutions out there that can help. For example, Treehouse offers thousands of hours of content on a wide range of programming languages like JavaScript and Python; TechDegrees has students complete a series of projects that form a portfolio for future employers; and Udemy, one of the biggest players in online learning, now offers courses on programming in addition to things like coffee making and art.</p>
<p>In addition, big tech companies are making their own online resources and training programs available to anyone with a desire to learn, including the likes of Google, Amazon, and Salesforce. </p>
<p>The best of these programs offer a gamified experience, rewarding users who successfully complete certain challenges with badges and other distinctions – helping keep learners engaged, and making it easier for those in the tech industry to spot real trail blazers.</p>
<p>By upgrading our users, we can empower them to join the app development cycle. The torrent of app requests eases down to a trickle because business users are equipped to build the apps they need. As developers, we can then have more room to focus on developing next generation <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/uk/blog/2016/11/app-dapting-to-great-expectations.html">apps that unlock business value</a> in ways never before possible – harnessing the power of nascent technology like Natural Language Processing and mixed reality. In doing so, we can ensure the development team itself is empowered to deliver technical innovation for customer success.</p>

        <projectTitle><![CDATA[Accessibility Project]]></projectTitle>
        <projectDescription><![CDATA[<p>The Accessibility Project is a community-driven effort to make web accessibility easier for frontend designers and developers to understand and adopt in to a daily workflow.</p>
<p>As Dave Rupert of Paravel, one of the 40+ group of coders and accessibility experts behind the project, explains: "The project started in mid-January 2013 amid developer sentiment that core accessibility concepts, features and code examples are overly difficult to extract. Since launch, <a href="http://a11yproject.com" target="_blank" class="hawk-link-parsed">a11yproject.com</a> has had 46,000 visitors and we're currently seeing about 7,000 monthly visitors."</p>
<p>Feedback has been mixed: "We've been told everything from 'Stop peddling bullshit' to 'Thank you for making accessibility more accessible'," Rupert reveals. "In general, the sentiment is positive and it solves a common desire for most frontend developers. If there is negative feedback (for example, errata or a difference of opinion) people are encouraged to file an issue on GitHub. Open source is working and iron is sharpening iron.</p>]]></projectDescription>

        <projectDescription><![CDATA[<p>Firefox OS, the new operating sysyem being developed by Mozilla, is a win for developers says Andreas Gal, vice president of mobile engineering at Mozilla. "The more platforms developers have to develop for, the more complicated their lives become," he reasons.</p>
<p>"Mozilla’s aim is to be a catalyst to drive more development for the Open Web. Over eight million developers develop in HTML5 today compared to around 100,000 iOS developers and 400,000 Android but 10 million for HTML5. We just want to unlock the power of HTML5 for standards-based work.</p>
<p>"Web apps can access all the device capabilities with the new web APIs that Mozilla added - closing the gap between web and native apps," Gal continues. "This will lower the barrier to entry for smaller, local content developers, businesses, educators and government organizations as well because HTML5 and Web technologies are familiar to developers</p>

        <projectTitle><![CDATA[Ember.js]]></projectTitle>
        <projectDescription><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Ember.js bills itself as "a framework for creating ambitious web applications". Jack Franklin explains: "Ember's main features are its data binding; obejcts in Ember can bind properties to each other, so when a property changes in one object, the other is kept in sync.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Another is the ability to define functions on an object that you can then treat as properties. Hence, if a model has a first and last name, you could create a function to define a person's full name, and have it treated as if the model has a fullname property.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"The feature most likely to draw you in is that Ember automatically updates its views when data changes - saving you a lot of work."</p>

        <projectTitle><![CDATA[AngularJS]]></projectTitle>
        <projectDescription><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">AngularJS extends the vocabulary of HTML for declaring dynamic views in web apps. Again, Jack Franklin explains: "Angular takes a slightly different approach [to Backbone and Ember] by doing data binding directly in your HTML. It also uses just plain JavaScript for its controllers, meaning there's no need to extend other objects as you have to do in other frameworks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"The data binding means data in views is automatically updated when the data changes, but also Angular makes it effortless to bind forms to models, meaning a lot of the code you typically write to link a form to creating a new instance of a model is not needed. Its data binding is bi-directional.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"By moving a lot of the binding directly into the HTML, Angular leaves you with much leaner controllers and less JavaScript to write. It might take a while to get your head around, but this approach is really powerful."</p>

        <projectTitle><![CDATA[Boostrap]]></projectTitle>
        <projectDescription><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">Since it was launched by Twitter in 2011, web building framework Bootstrap has become the most popular project on GitHub. Its creators Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton decided last September to move Bootstrap to its own open source organisation, and the project separated from Twitter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Bootstrap benefits from a small footprint, LESS integration and compelling visual design. It has a web-based customiser that you can use to tailor it to your open source project: components and jQuery plug-ins can be added or removed by ticking checkboxes, and variables can be customised using a web form. There's a 12-column responsive grid, typography, form controls and it uses responsive CSS to work with mobile browsers.</p>
